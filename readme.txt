Create advanced chatbots and connect them to your website. Use existing components or create new ones using Dialogflow, MS bot framework, Rasa and more.

== Description ==

Cocohub allows you to create bots - with a human touch.
 
Using friendly templates, drag&drop building blocks and pre-built intents (understanding what the user wants), you can create a fully functional conversational bot - in minutes.  You don't need any previous coding skills or prior knowledge.

How do you connect a Wordpress bot to your website? 
1. First of all, log in, choose your bot's personality - appearance, voice, name and base persona. 
2. Then, choose a template - one that can be adapted or changed afterwards. This will be the bot's brain, or what it actually does.
3. After building your bot, go to the "Text" option in the testing area on the main bot dashboard.
4. Once it's ready, choose your plan.
5. After choosing your plan, go to the channels, choose "Wordpress", and click "Connect", then, "Copy channel ID"
6. After activating the plugin, go to "settings", customize the bot's dimensions, icon and other details; paste the channel ID you copied into the relevant space.
7. Go to your website's code, write [cocobot] and save.
8. It's ready! Start enjoying your chatbot.

== Installation ==

Install and activate the plugin.
Under the plugin settings set your bot name and set your bot component_url from cocohub.ai

Use the shortcode [cocobot] to add it to your page
